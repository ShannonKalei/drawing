# Drawing

Just a drawing app.  Still a work in progress, but mostly just trying things out.

## Demo

Interactive demo hosted on GitHub Pages: <https://shannonkalei.github.io/drawing/>.

## Roadmap
- Undo/redo
- Additional shape transforms (re-size, rotate, etc)
- Erase/delete tool
- More accessibility coverage (full keyboard support on canvas)
- Export drawings
- Layer controls (create, delete, merge, etc)
- Favorite/Saved color swatches
- Canvas grid/snapping
- Mobile support

## Dev

Run the command `npm start` in the main directory to run the app locally.
